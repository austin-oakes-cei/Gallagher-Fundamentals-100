- **Overview of prompt engineering:** Introduction to prompt engineering techniques to guide GitHub Copilotâ€™s suggestions and improve the relevance / accuracy of generated code 

## Instructions
Labs should be completed consecutively starting with Lab 1 and ending with Lab 6. Any files required for completing your labs will reside within the `lab-files` directory.


## Labs
1. [Setup and Configuration](labs/lab1-setup-and-configuration.md)
This lab is designed to help you get your development environment set up and ready to go for the rest of the course. You will install the necessary tools and software, and verify that everything is working as expected. If you have the tools and software already installed, you can skip this lab and proceed to the next lab.
2. [Experimenting with GitHub Copilot Code Suggestions](lab-handouts/lab2-copilot-code-suggestions.md)
In this exercise, you will have the opportunity to experiment with in-file code suggestions, multiple suggestions, and comprehensive code suggestions with the assistance of GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat.
3. [Generating ARM, Terraform and Powershell Code with GitHub Copilot](lab-handouts/lab3-scripting.md)
This lab will allow you to generate ARM and Terraform code for deploying a storage account to Azure using GitHub Copilot Chat.
4. [Performing Code Refactoring with GitHub Copilot](lab-handouts/lab4-code-refactoring.md)
In this lab, you will participate in a learning or practice activity where your main goal will be to use GitHub Copilot for code refactoring using the C# programming language.
5. [Creating Unit Tests with GitHub Copilot](lab-handouts/lab5-unit-testing.md)
GitHub Copilot can be used to generate unit test functions for a variety of programming languages. This lab will guide you through the process of creating a calculator program and generating unit tests for each function using GitHub Copilot Chat.
6. [Generating Documentation with GitHub Copilot](lab-handouts/lab6-generating-documentation.md)
GitHub Copilot can help streamline the process of generating documentation for your software projects. It assists by auto-generating code comments, creating Markdown documentation, providing templates for common sections, ensuring grammar and style consistency, and cross-referencing code and documentation. This tool can save time and improve the quality of your project's documentation, making it more accessible and user-friendly.
